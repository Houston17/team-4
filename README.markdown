## Self Service Stories

Our web application built using Ruby on Rails for the server and bootflat for the design is a platform for SEARCH's stories to be told through a timeline for each client showing the major roles that SEARCH played in the part of getting them off the streets.

The Self Service reduces administrative overhead. It has options for sharing the webpage on Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

This web application also allows for volunteers to recognize their contributions and efforts.
